  <h1>Description</h1>
<p>The mission of this project is helping you find a better place to live when you have options to choose. 
Although there are lots of considerations in real estate apps or websites, we can talk about some important topics for choosing a place to live!  
Based on a study by The Public Health Alliance of Southern California, Healthy place index is a combination of different factors such as Economic; Education; Housing; Health Care Access; Neighborhood; Clean Environment; Transportation; and Social factors. 
You can choose different zip codes in california and see the comparison between the scores on the radar chart. The scores are between 0 and 100 and 100 is the best. 
Not only you can see the scores for the selected area, but also you can see all the scores based on each index on the california map in the Map tab.
